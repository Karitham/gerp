to enable auto completions for zsh:
run `gerp --generate-completion zsh`
copy the output and paste into some file
then, in your zsh profile (usually ~/zshrc), add these lines:

PROG=gerp
_CLI_ZSH_AUTOCOMPLETE_HACK=1
source  path/to/autocomplete_file

replace autocomplete_file with the file you just created
