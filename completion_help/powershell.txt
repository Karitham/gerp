to enable auto completions for powershell:
run `gerp --generate-completion powershell`
copy the output and paste into `gerp.ps1` somewhere in your system (location doesn't matter, file name does)
in your powershell profile add these lines, replacing <path> with the path of `gerp.ps1` you just created

. <path>

notice the ".", it's necessary to put a space after it.
you can optionally do:

import-module <path>
